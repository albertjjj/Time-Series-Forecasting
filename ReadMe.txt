- This was code I wrote for my extended essay. 
- The essay was on comparing different time series forecasting algorithms and was an introduction to machine learning for me.
- The Shampoo.py file is the main code in which I use an example dataset called Shampoo sales and then plug it into the moving average and autoregressive models. 
- The stockAPI.py file is something extra that I made to find and format historical stock price data so that I can use it with the models. 
- I tested it with Bitcoina and got surprisingly good results but I wouldn't go buying anything based off of my code.
